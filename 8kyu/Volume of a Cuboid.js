// Bob needs a fast way to calculate the volume of a cuboid with three values: the length, width and height of the cuboid. Write a function to help Bob with this calculation.



function getVolumeOfCuboid(length, width, height) {
    // Volume is length times width times height. So just return those variables multiplied together.
    return length * width * height
}
